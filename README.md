1. The goal of the game is to get the bunny to the other side of the road without getting hit by traffic. In order to succeed, _you will need to collect the carrot_ on the other side of the road.

2. Movement Controls:

    In order to move accross the screen, you will need to use your directional arrow keys on the keyboard.
    - Use the **&larr;** arrow key to move left.
    - Use the **&rarr;** arrow key to move right.
    - Use the **&uarr;** arrow key to move up.
    - Use the **&darr;** arrow key to move down.
    
3. General Key Controls:

    - Use the  **S**  key to start and stop/pause the game.
    - Use the  **R**  key to reset the game. (Note that this will not reset your health and score, but only the location of the carrot and create new cars and bikes.)

4. Points are collected when you cross the road and collect the carrot. Every time you collect the carrot you will be awarded 20 points.

5. When you start the game, your health will begin with four hearts. If you collide with a car or a bicycle you will lose one of your hearts. Once you have lost all four hearts, the game will end and everything in the game will be reset, including your score and health.

6. Good luck and enjoy!
